# Diabetes Simulators 

## Type 1 Diabetes Simulators

* [Simglucose](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose) - A Type-1 Diabetes simulator implemented in Python for Reinforcement Learning purpose.
* [APS_TestBed](https://github.com/UVA-DSA/APS_TestBed) - A closed-loop testbed for the artificial pancreas system (APS) that evaluates the effectiveness of new control algorithms and other features for the APS in both normal and hazardous environments. The testbed is made up of two APS simulators, UVA/Padova and Glucosym, and a fault injection engine. This repository also includes a dataset we generated with the testbed containing both safe and hazardous data traces from APS.
* [LT1](https://github.com/hpeuscher/loopinsight1) - A closed-loop simulation software of automatic insulin delivery systems for type 1 diabetic persons.
* [CGMSIM](https://lsandini.github.io/cgmsim-site/) - A real-time T1D simulation for teaching/training purposes.

## Type 2 Diabetes Simulators

* [AAU T2D](https://gitlab.com/aau-adapt-t2d/aau-t2d-simulator) - A type 2 diabetes simulator with web based GUI.
## Discrete Events Simulators

* [CarbMetSim](https://github.com/mukulgoyalmke/CarbMetSim) - A discrete event simulator for tracking blood glucose level based on carbodydrate metabolism in human body.

## Digital Twin-Based Simulators

* [ReplayBG](https://github.com/gcappon/replay-bg) - ReplayBG is a digital twin-based MATLAB® toolbox to assess new strategies for type 1 diabetes management on retrospective patient data.
